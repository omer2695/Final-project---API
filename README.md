To install and set up the project locally, follow these steps:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/business-property-scoring.git
   ```

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```shell

```

3. Run the API service:

## Usage
To use the API service, send POST requests to the following endpoint:

/predict: Endpoint for making predictions. Send a POST request with JSON data containing property information to receive a score prediction.
Example JSON request:
```shell
{
  "areaCategory": 1,
  "Floor": 0,

  "publicTransport": 1,
  "publicParking": 1
}
```

## Example JSON response:

```shell
{
  "prediction": 1
}
```

| score  | status |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 0  | bad  |
| 1  | good  |
| 2  | very good  |
